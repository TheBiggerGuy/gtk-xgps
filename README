This is a new version of the 'xgps' program to try and fulfil this wish

	*** Rewrite xgps

	The Motif/Lesstif dependency is a pain in the butt, the code is a 
	maintainability problem, and we'd like to extend it to display AIS
	messages. Probably the thing to do is write something pygtk-based.

The original program is available from "http://gpsd.berlios.de/index.html"
